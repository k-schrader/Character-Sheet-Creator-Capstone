                <h1>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h1>
                <form>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dungeons and Dragons is a "table-top role-playing game". This means it is a game mostly of
                            imagination!</li>
                        <li>Players create a fantasy character (maybe they can cast magic spells, maybe they can sword
                            fight) and come together
                            at the table.</li>
                        <li>One player -The Dungeon Master- creates the settings and events in their head
                            and invites everyone else to interact with their story as their characters. </li>
                        <li>The players and DM roll dice and calculate scores to decide the outcome of their actions.
                        </li>
                        <li>The game is as age appropriate as the players and Dungeon Master make it, since it is mostly
                            imagined.</li>
                        <li>Dungeons and Dragons is a great exercise in creativity and group problem solving for your
                            child!</li>
                        <li>The calculation of dice rolls is a fun and enganging math practice.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Though violence is not a necessary part of the game, mixing swords and monsters usually
                            results in sword fighting. 
                            Parents should be aware of this and advise/monitor younger children as they see fit!</strong></li>
                    </ul>
